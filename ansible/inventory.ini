# This file is optional. The job executor uses dynamic inventory,
# targeting servers via their internalAddress at runtime.

# This file is useful for:
# - Manual playbook testing
# - Static host pool scenarios
# - Development/debugging
#
# Example:
# [gameservers]
# gameserver1 ansible_host=10.0.0.50 ansible_user=root
